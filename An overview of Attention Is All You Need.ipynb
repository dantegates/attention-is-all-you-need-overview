    "About a year ago now a paper called [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) (in this post sometimes referred to as simply \"the paper\") introduced an architecture called the Transformer model for sequence to sequence problems that achieved state of the art results in machine translation. The name of the paper is taken from the approach of building a model that leverages the widely successful attention mechanism within a more traditional \"feed forward\" framework without using recurrence or convolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since its introduction slight variations of the Transformer have been applied to a variety of problems, see [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor), outside of machine translation such as image classification, text summarization, speech recognition and even [generating fake wikipedia articles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBCqOTEfxvg).\n",

    "# Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going in depth, let's cover some preliminaries. If you are unfamiliar with the topics covered here you may want to do some additional research before continuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequence to sequence (seq2seq)**: Seq2seq models map input of an arbitrary length to an output of arbitrary length. This is different from the conventional notion of machine learning models which are trained on a feature space of *fixed* dimmension to predict an output of *fixed* dimmension. A positive example is translating sentences from English to French where both the input and output sentence could be of any length. As a negative example consider the [keras MNIST tutorial](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_mlp.py) which is typical of most machine learning models. This example classifies an image as one of **10** categories given the **784** pixels of the image. The traditional approach is a natural fit for many applications but for tasks such as machine translation seq2seq models are more intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: We won't discuss RNNs in much detail in this post. However to appreciate the Transformer model you should understand that RNNs, such as [LSTMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory), have been the leaders in the seq2seq space for a while. However, they have some limitations which are discussed in more detail in Attention Is All You Need.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: One typically thinks of convolutional neural networks in the context of images. However convolutional networks such as [ByteNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.10099.pdf) or [WaveNet](hhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf) were introduced to handle sequences by restricting the convolutions from \"looking forward\". As with RNNs we won't discuss this in detail and it's not important for understanding the Transformer but it is worth noting that the Transformer is copared against convolutional networks for sequences in Attention Is All You Need.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoder/decoder**: Encoder/decoder architectures refer to models with two components. The *encoder* creates a latent representation of the input. The *decoder* then maps this latent representation to the final prediction. This type of architecture is usually seen in RNNs (the encoding is the hidden state of the RNN and a decoder uses this hidden state to make a final prediction), however we'll see this is also a key element of the Transformer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention**: Attention can be understood in two ways. First, heuristically. Attention is something we apply to seq2seq models. The motivation is that some word(s) in \"Hello how are you?\" is/are more important than others to predict that \"Hola\" should appear as the first word in the corresponding Spanish translation. Attention is a learned mechanism that allows the model to pay attention to words that are more relevant than others. Second we can understand attention mathematically which we'll discuss this more below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Auto regressive**: In the most general sense an [autoregressive models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model) predict sequences where each new prediction depends on predictions of previous steps. In NLP this usually means that we predict one token of the output at a time given some input and the tokens previously predicted. keras has a pretty good [tutorial](https://blog.keras.io/a-ten-minute-introduction-to-sequence-to-sequence-learning-in-keras.html) that describes this process. This pattern is seen in RNNs and the Transformer follows suit."

    "# The Transformer at a High Level\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've covered the preliminaries we can discuss the Transformer at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, the Transformer model follows the encoder/decoder pattern mapping two input matrices (each containing sequences of word embeddings) of shape $n\\times d_{model}$ to a matrix of shape $n\\times\\text{vocab size}$ where $n$ is the sequence size. The Transformer is a true seq2seq model and therefore $n$ is not fixed but determined by the length of the sequence(s) at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer makes predictions without recurrence or convolutions and rather stacks dense layers seen in traditional deep neural networks with an attention mechanism as the activation function of certain layers. In particular the Transformer makes use of something known as \"multi-head attention\". While multi-head attention was not introduced by this model, it was by one of the authors of Attention Is All You Need and improved on in the Transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer incorporates the usual NLP tricks along with various state of the art techniques all into one architecture. Examples include word embeddings, residual connections, layer normalization, learning rate scheduling and byte pair encoding."

    "First, let's cover the data processing used in the paper - Byte Pair Encoding or BPE.\n",
    "\n",
    "BPE is a particular implementation of the more general notion of [subword units](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1162), a simple but powerful idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subword units is based on the intuition that pieces of a word may generalize better in machine translation than the entire word itself. As a simple example we can see that the subword units `[\"pre\", \"determine\", \"d\"]` together carry all of the information required to express the word `\"predetermined\"`, but some additional information as well that may be useful for generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "BPE is essentially a greedy algorithm that learns the optimal subword units needed to tokenize a given corpus given a constraint on the number of subword units it must learn. The paper above gives the following example. Given the corpus `[\"low\", \"lowest\", \"newer\", \"wider\"]` BPE would learn to tokenize `\"lower\"` as `[\"low\", \"er\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to the advantages of BPE. Namely Subword units frees machine translation models of restrictions imposed by learning from a fixed dictionary. Notice in the example above `\"lower\"` was tokenized in a meaningful way but was not part of the training corpus. This is distinguished from the paradigm where a model is trained on a fixed dictionary of the top $N$ most popular words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only does this reduce the number of out of vocabulary tokens required at train time, it also introduces the possibility of correctly predicting words *not seen* at train time by predicting the correct subword units."

    "At train time we know all tokens of the target sequence. However at run time we only know the tokens of the target sequence that we have already generated. This means that if we aren't careful with how we implement the product $QK$ information from later tokens in the sequence will \"leak\" into earlier positions. To prevent this from happening we mask $K$ by setting all values above the diagonal to a really small number - which pushes the corresponding dot products to 0 in the softmax."

As mentioned above this is a topic that deserves its own comprehensive treatment. For more details see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05027.pdf. One key thing to know about residual connections however is that they help combat the [vanishing gradient problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem)."

    "[Batch normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf) is a method that has been shown to significantly decrease the amount of time needed during training for deep neural networks to converge. The name of the method is self explanatory. To implement batch normalization one simply normalizes each batch by substracting of the mean value of the batch and dividing by the variance (additionally learned \"gain\" and \"bias\" parameters are applied to each batch). This prevents what is known as \"internal covariate shift\"\n",

    "- Training examples (sentences for translation) are \"batched\" together according to the number of tokens in each sentence.\n",
    "- From these \"batches\" training \"steps\" are constructed by grouping examples together to reach an approximate number of tokens desired per step - this is a shift from the typical notion when training on features of fixed dimmension where batches contain a *fixed* number of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to take note of the following details.\n",
    "1. A gradient update is performed at each \"step\" - thus in this case what the paper refers to as training steps is more similar to a training batch in other contexts. Indeed, even in the tensor2tensor [source](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/blob/342e214dea360a7f472fc82f3dd0775d7e224c52/tensor2tensor/layers/common_hparams.py#L34) the word \"batch_size\" is used to describe what would be called a \"step\" size in the paper.\n",
